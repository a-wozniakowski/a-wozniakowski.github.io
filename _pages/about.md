Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple; and I have interests
in applied and computational mathematics, machine learning, and
statisics research and applications.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) in 2022. In my [dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311),
I developed a hybrid of additive and varying coefficient models that enables a
fitting algorithm to leverage prior knowledge encoded in predictions from a base
model to build a complex model.
- Notably, this approach resulted in a generalization of gradient
boosting, known as base boosting.
  - That is, gradient boosting initializes its fit of an additive model
  at a constant model then iteratively improves upon it.
  - Base boosting, on the other hand, initializes its fit of the hybrid additive
  and varying coefficient model at the base model, which may be a non-constant
  model, then iteratively improves upon it.
- Empirically, base boosting outperformed popular boosting libraries and
Google's quantum physics model on quantum device and Taylor series data sets.

Additionally, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University, where I established the link between the mathematics
of planar algebras and the science of quantum information and computation.
- This led to a collaboration in which multiple charged string picture
languages were developed.
