Currently, I am a software engineer at Apple; and I have interests
in applied and computational mathematics, machine learning, and
statisics research and applications.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) in 2022. In my [dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/10356/163311),
I developed a framework to transfer knowledge encoded in predictions to a
learning algorithm, which fits a hybrid of an additive and varying coefficient
model.
- Notably, this approach resulted in base boosting, which is a generalization
of gradient boosting.
  - That is, gradient boosting fits an additive model, where the boosting
  mechanism begins optimization in function space at a constant model.
  - Base boosting, on the other hand, fits a hybrid of an additive and varying
  coefficient model, where the boosting mechanism begins optimization in
  function space at a base model, which may be a non-constant model.
- Empirically, base boosting outperformed popular boosting libraries and Google's
quantum physics model on quantum device and Taylor series data sets.

Additionally, I am an original member of the 
[Mathematical Picture Language Project](https://mathpicture.fas.harvard.edu/)
at Harvard University, where I established the link between the mathematics
of planar algebras and the science of quantum information and computation.
- This led to a collaboration in which multiple charged string picture
languages were developed.
